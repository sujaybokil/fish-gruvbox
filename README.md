# Gruvbox Theme for [Fish](http://fishshell.com)

> The best colorscheme known to man for [friendly interactive shell (fish)](http://fishshell.com)
> This theme is just a lazy fork of [dracula/fish](https://github.com/dracula/fish) with colours swapped for the gruvbox theme


## Install

Use your package manager to install the theme

```bash
# Using omf
omf install https://github.com/sujaybokil/fish-gruvbox
# Using fisher
fisher install https://github.com/sujaybokil/fish-gruvbox
```


### Note 

The colors are just swapped from the original Dracula fork and they are not set to what actual semantic highlights in gruvbox would look like. For example, dracula uses yellow colour for strings, so this theme uses the same but it uses the yellow from Gruvbox instead. If you want to update the theme with proper gruvbox colors, please submit a PR.
